    <!-- ABOUT SECTION -->
    <h2 class="page-section-title">
      Hello!
    </h2>
    <p>
      I am a first-generation Canadian-born Chinese user experience and user interface (UX/UI) designer. My passion lies in user research: personas, ethnography, user interviews, etc. As someone who enjoys personal understanding and reflection, user research allows me not only to exert empathy and learn about individuals, but to learn more about myself in the process. As a third culture child, I strive to gain a better understanding of myself as both ethnically Chinese and a Canadian citizen and how I fit in Western society while being a designer.
