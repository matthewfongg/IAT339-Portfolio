              From our research, we found that the City of Surrey's Accountability Board - a clipboard that a fire captain or battalion chief uses for tracking fire fighters during a fire call, was a frustration within the fire fall (See the following images). We learned of many issues such as high potential in losing name tags that are required to be attached to the Board, the severe lack of space for writing content, the constant need for the fire captain or battalion chief to write and erase content as updates come in through their headsets.
            </p>
            <p>
              We designed a digital application intended to be on a tablet interface. This application allows for proper streamlining such as using features such as voice-to-text as well as interactions like drag and drop to replace writing (and typing), decreasing the stress of fire calls.

              My group partner and I had the opportunity to sit with the fire fighters of Surrey Fire Hall 11 and converse in a very casual conversation. This approach was done in order to remove the setting of an actual interview. We also had the opportunity to receive a tour of the fire hall as well as learn about the military-like culture of fire fighters.

              At the end of our first day with the fire fighters, we were allowed to ride in their fire truck as they conversed with us about what happens should there have been an emergency. The entire experience provided a general understanding of how fire fighters work and behave. For this research method, I designed the layout of our slide deck.

            Cultural Probes

              My group partner and I developed four activities for our cultural probe. We noticed that many of the firefighters don't often talk about emotions and struggles on the job. My group member's father is the fire captain of Fire Hall 11 and he informed me that is a high percentage of fire fighters with PTSD.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="block">
            <p class="copy">
              We believed that this research method would be an opportunity to get the fire fighters to express themselves, especially in a private and comfortable situation. We decided to be creative and have our cultural probe be presented in the form of a mini firetruck.

              Our first activity was a chart in which allowed the fire fighters to tell us whether or not a certain call they went on was worthwhile or not. Often, fire fighters receive calls in which they feel were not worthwhile or prevented them from attending a more serious call.

          <div class="block">
            <p class="copy">
              Our second activity required the fire fighters to write on a Post-it® note any frustrations they're feeling as well as any highlights during their day. This was an opportunity for them to vent, but also be thankful for the good things in their life. Many of the firefighters wrote things about their family, specifically their children.

              Our third activity was a clean side of the firetruck where the fire fighters could just doodle and have fun. Although this activity didn't necessarily have a defined goal, we wanted to use this qualitative activity to see if we could find anything. One firefighter (seen in the figure above) wrote what my partner and I believe were terms tied to firefighting.

          </div>
          <div class="block">
            <p>
              Our final activity was to have the fire fighters take photos on disposable cameras during their shifts. Of course, this was left within their discretion on what to take and was a more qualitative activity. A few of the firefighters actually took photos of some of the calls they attended to, such as the car crash shown above.

              Firefighters are required to be in the healthiest condition possible, meaning healthy diets and a consistent fitness routine. One of our previous design focuses was focusing on the high amount of administrative paperwork required by firefighters cuts time out of or prevent them from doing proper drills and routines.

              With out citizen persona, we wanted to place emphasis on another issue we found from the fire fighters. If there is a 9-1-1 call about an allergy - for example a peanut allergy, although fire fighters are known as first respondants, they are not allowed to administer epipens. They must wait until an ambulance arrives for them to administer it, despite fire fighters being trained in first aid.

              This research method allowed for us to directly have the fire fighters assist us with our design. We had our fire fighters perform workshop activites such as laying out a tablet interface based off their liking. This allowed us to gauge their conventions and preference and to consider them for our final design.

              For our other activity, we asked each of the firefighters to select 15 icons from a collection of 20 icons that they liked. Then, we had a discussion about the 5 they didn't choose and why they didn't like it. This allowed for us to learn semantics behind icons and to evaluate their values.

              From this project, I had the opportunity to learn a breadth of different research design methods while being used in a real-world context. I was able to collect data from these methods and wrangle our data to be interpreted into sensible information.

              Our conclusive data led to a greater understanding of our group of firefighters to best accomodate their needs for our design for them, the users. In the end, this project helped ignite passion for user research.
