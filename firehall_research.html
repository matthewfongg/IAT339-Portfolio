            This project is from IAT 333: Interactive Design Methods offered at Simon Fraser University. Curriculum included research methods such as ethnography, cultural probes, informances, journey frameworks, personas, and participatory workshops. My project group worked with Surrey Fire Hall 11 to practice these methods to discover potential problems in their everyday routine to develop a speculative solution to their issue.

            At the end of our research, we designed a digital prototype of the City of Surrey’s accountability board, a physical board used to track all information during fire calls. I was in charge of wireframming and mocking up the final protoype of our final product.

          Weekly, I would design slide decks for my group partner and I to present to the class and receive feedback from the teaching staff. Our design focus was to simplify the amount of paperwork that is required for the City of Surrey, allowing firefighters to train and practice more drills. During week 10, we were informed that our progress had to come to a halt as we were trying to alter government official documents, which were not feasible. My group partner and I had to regroup and reassess our data collected to find a new solution. In the end, we designed digital prototype of the City of Surrey’s accountability board, a physical board used to track all information during fire calls.

          My group partner and I had the opportunity to present our project to the City of Surrey’s Chief of Training and Vice Fire Chief (official name to be confirmed). The Chief of Training who created the physical accountability board noted that our design would relieve several of the existing problems and implement better streamlining. Our final design resulted in an A.
