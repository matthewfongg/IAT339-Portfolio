            From our research, we found that the City of Surrey's Accountability Board - a clipboard that a fire captain or battalion chief uses for tracking fire fighters during a fire call, was a frustration within the fire fall. We learned of many issues such as high potential in losing name tags that are required to be attached to the Board, the severe lack of space for writing content, the constant need for the fire captain/battalion chief to write and erase content as updates come in through their headsets.
          </p>
          <p>
            We designed a digital application intended to be on a tablet interface. This application allows for proper streamlining such as using
            features such as voice-to-text as well as interactions like drag and drop to replace writing (and typing), decreasing the stress of fire calls.

            This project is from IAT 333: Interactive Design Methods offered at Simon Fraser University. Curriculum included research methods such as ethnography, cultural probes, informances, journey frameworks, personas, and participatory workshops. My project group worked with Surrey Fire Hall 11 to practice these methods to discover potential problems in their everyday routine to develop a speculative solution to their issue.
          </p>

          <p>
            At the end of our research, we designed a digital prototype of the City of Surrey’s accountability board, a physical board used to track all information during fire calls. I was in charge of wireframming and mocking up the final protoype of our final product.

            My group partner and I had the opportunity to sit with the fire fighters of Surrey Fire Hall 11 and converse in a very casual conversation. This approach was done in order to remove the setting of an actual interview. We also had the opportunity to receive a tour of the fire hall as well as learn about the military-like culture of fire fighters. At the end of our first day with the fire fighters, we were allowed to ride in their fire truck as they conversed with us about what happens should there have been an emergency. The entire experience provided a general understanding of how fire fighters work and behave. For this research method, I designed the layout of our slide deck.

            Cultural Probes

        <div class="block">
          <p class="copy">
            My group partner and I developed four activities for our cultural probe. We noticed that many of the firefighters don't often talk about emotions and struggles on the job. My group member's father is the fire captain of Fire Hall 11 and he informed me that is a high percentage of fire fighters with PTSD. We believed that this research method would be an opportunity to get the fire fighters to express themselves, especially in a private and comfortable situation. We decided to be creative and have our cultural probe be presented in the form of a mini firetruck.

            Our first activity was a chart in which allowed the fire fighters to tell us whether or not a certain call they went on was worthwhile or not. Often, fire fighters receive calls in which they feel were not worthwhile or prevented them from attending a more serious call.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our second activity required the fire fighters to write on a Post-it® note any frustrations they're feeling as well as any highlights during their day. This was an opportunity for them to vent, but also be thankful for the good things in their life. Many of the firefighters wrote things about their family, specifically their children.

            Our third activity was a clean side of the firetruck where the fire fighters could just doodle and have fun. Although this activity didn't necessarily have a defined end goal, we wanted to use this qualitative activity to see if we could find anything. One firefighter (seen in the figure above) wrote what my partner and I believe were terms tied to firefighting.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our final activity was to have the fire fighters take photos on disposable cameras during their shifts. Of course, this was left within their discretion on what to take and was a more qualitative activity. A few of the firefighters actually took photos of some of the calls they attended to, such as the car crash shown above.

            From the data we've collected thus far, we developed three personas related to firefighting: two firefighters and a citizen. While the template used for our personas was designed by my group partner, I developed the two personas shown above. These two personas were necessary for the sake of starting to better understand and solidify what we know about fire fighters and citizens (relative to the knowledge we've gained from fire fighters).
          </p>
          <p>
            Firefighters are required to be in the healthiest condition possible, meaning healthy diets and a consistent fitness routine. One of our previous design focuses was focusing on the high amount of administrative paperwork required by firefighters cuts time out of or prevent them from doing proper drills and routines.
          </p>
          <p>
            With out citizen persona, we wanted to place emphasis on another issue we found from the fire fighters. If there is a 9-1-1 call about an allergy - for example a peanut allergy, although fire fighters are known as first respondants, they are not allowed to administer epipens. They must wait until an ambulance arrives for them to administer it, despite fire fighters being trained in first aid.

            This research method allowed for us to directly have the fire fighters assist us with our design. We had our fire fighters perform workshop activites such as laying out a tablet interface based off their liking. This allowed us to gauge their conventions and preference and to consider them for our final design. For our other activity, we asked each of the firefighters to select 15 icons from a collection of 20 icons that they liked. Then, we had a discussion about the 5 they didn't choose and why they didn't like it. This allowed for us to learn semantics behind icons and to evaluate their values.

          <!-- Weekly, I would design slide decks for my group partner and I to present to the class and receive feedback from the teaching staff. Our design focus was to simplify the amount of paperwork that is required for the City of Surrey, allowing firefighters to train and practice more drills. During week 10, we were informed that our progress had to come to a halt as we were trying to alter government official documents, which were not feasible. My group partner and I had to regroup and reassess our data collected to find a new solution. In the end, we designed digital prototype of the City of Surrey’s accountability board, a physical board used to track all information during fire calls. -->

          My group partner and I had the opportunity to present our project to the City of Surrey’s Chief of Training and Assistant Fire Chief. The Chief of Training who created the current Accountability Board noted that our design would relieve several of the existing problems and implement better streamlining. They were able to be a part of our final project video. Our final design resulted in an A.
