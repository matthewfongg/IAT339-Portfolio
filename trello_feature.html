              This project is from IAT 334, Interface Design, offered at Simon Fraser University. Using user research methods from IDEO Method Cards, I came up with a set of interview questions for my group partner and I to use with participants. Methods such as Survey &amp; Questionnaires, Competitive Product Survey were used.

        </div>

        <p>
            An issue we came across was the lack of access to users of Trello. Due to time constraints, I suggested that interviews be done with individuals who have used any form of project management applications, such as Strike, Asana, as well as native operative system Calendar, Reminders, Tasks, Notes, and/or Clock applications. With this, we successfully collected sufficient data to analyze and develop primary and secondary personas for Trello users.

          We noticed that our participants used various messenger platforms for team discussions like Facebook Messenger and Slack and concluded that this be our design focus: develop an instant messaging (IM) feature within Trello to avoid multiple application use. However, my group partner felt that any application can implement an IM feature and that ours should be unique. From this, I further developed the feature to include an option for Trello users to save brainstorming messages to a separate part of Trello that the group can assess and evaluate without unnecessary group chatter and being required to sift through messages. Fortunately, our feature impressed the teaching staff, resulting in an A-.

          From this project, I was a consistent problem solver. Although our issues did not necessarily lie in the design process, critical thinking was required in order to maneuver around obstacles such as finding users for our interviews. With only a week to interview users and develop personas, deciding to interview users with alternative project management applications was the best we could have done to simulate the real thing. Moreover, critical thinking also helped with furthering my group partner's notion that an instant messaging feature isn't enough. By going the extra mile and listing actions that people do when conversing with group members via online messaging, this led to the implementation of our key feature: converting messages into cards. This feature was also optimal as we were able to exercise our understanding of Trello's interactions and overall conventions to allow the feature to fit naturally.
