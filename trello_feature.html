        <p>
          From our research, we noticed that our participants used various messenger platforms for team discussions such as Facebook Messenger, and Slack. We designed a unique instant messaging (IM) feature within Trello to avoid multiple application use.

              Conducting User Interviews
            </h3>
            <p class="copy">
              Using user research methods from IDEO Method Cards, I came up with a set of interview questions for my group partner and I to use with participants. Methods such as Survey &amp; Questionnaires, Intensive User Interviews, and Competitive Product Survey were used.

              Problem Solving
            </h3>
            <p class="copy">
              An issue we came across was the lack of access to users of Trello. To counter, derived from the Competitive Product Survey research method, I suggested that interviews be done with individuals who have used any form of project management application. Such include Strike, Asana, and native operative system applications (Calendar, Reminders, Tasks, Notes, and/or Clock). With this, we successfully collected sufficient data to analyze.

            Personas
          </h3>
          <p>
            While both my partner and I established a primary and secondary personas for Trello users, I focused on developing and expanding on our secondary persona. For context, we found that primary users of Trello use the application for collaborative purposes.
          </p>
        </div>

        </div>
        <div class="block">
          <p>
            We found that although Trello's primarily used for collaborative efforts, it's project management theme works as well for personal use. Trello provides the tools for an individual to manage scheduling for personal, work, and school matters.

            <!-- We were able to evaluate users and their usage of native operating system applications such as Clock, Reminders, Notes, and Alarms that Trello condenses into a single application. -->
          </p>

          <p>
            By developing personas, it allowed my group partner and I to better define who to design for. Since Trello is primarily used for collaborative efforts, our feature focused on mainly that aspect to satisfy both personas.

          Final Implementation
        </h2>
      </div>

      <div class="content-card">
        <p>
          Upon deciding to develop an IM feature, my group partner felt that any application could implement an IM feature and that ours should be unique. From this, I further developed the feature by suggesting we include an option for Trello users to save brainstorming messages to a separate part of Trello that the group can later assess and evaluate without unnecessary group chatter and being required to sift through messages.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="section-divider">

          Reflection
        </h2>
      </div>


      <div class="content-card">
        <p>
          Throughout the project, I was a consistent problem solver. Although issues did not necessarily lie in the design process, critical thinking was required in order to maneuver around obstacles such as finding users for our interviews. With only a week to interview users and develop personas, deciding to interview users with alternative project management applications was the best we could have done to simulate the real thing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover, critical thinking also helped with furthering my group partner's notion that an instant messaging feature isn't enough. By going the extra mile and listing actions that people do when conversing with group members via online messaging, this led to the implementation of our key feature: converting messages into cards. This feature was also optimal as we were able to exercise our understanding of Trello's interactions and overall conventions to allow the feature to fit naturally.
